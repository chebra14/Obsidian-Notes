## Week 20

#### General

- [x] LinkedIn

#### F1Tenth Car

- [ ] Car safety
	- [ ] Wires safe
	- [ ] Body safe
	- [ ] LiDAR Safe
- [x] Design Experiment
	- Try and match shapes of the graphs not values
	- How do I measure velocity
		- Create dumb velocity estimator
		- [x] Get Values
		- [x] Interpret values
			- [x] Try Polyfit
		- Option 1: Get LiDAR to measure velocity (Difficult and noisy but synched)
		- Option 2: External velocity sensing (Easy but challenge to sync)
		- Possibly integrate the position from the LiDAR
	- [x] Autonomous Slow
	- [x] Autonomous Fast
- [x] Brake overshoot problem

#### Simulator

- [x] Compare the original Yiming algorithm (Show crash)
- [ ] Create adjusted algorithm
- [ ] Think of ideas for traction control
- [x] Make the start-stop shorter

#### Research

- [ ] Read MAP paper again
- [ ] Read 2 papers
- [ ] Create diagram of internal/external influences
#### PocketQube

##### Notes
- brake overshoot fixed, but the car cannot go backwards
- Readjusted the gain for the servo. Much better now

Future work:
- Create a better velocity estimator
Flaw with current measurement.

Add PCV to the wheels
Consider the external velocity measurement
