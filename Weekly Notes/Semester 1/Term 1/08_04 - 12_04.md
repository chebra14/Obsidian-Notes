F1Tenth related progress
Potential projects

- Creating safety measures for driving the car fast in the lab
	- Measures for the environment
	- Measures for the car
- Create an ABS system for the car
	- Find the longitudinal limit of the tires.
		- Different from normal ABS
		- The brakes can be adjusted after going over the limit
	- First step is to understand how the braking works for the F1Tenth car
	- Create an algorithm that would work independent of any braking type

Proposed paper plan:

1. Generate current best results. What are the current best lap times
2. Why are these limits here? What breaks if I go faster?
3. Implement an improvement that improves lap time
4. Write down improvement with experimental results

Repeat process
