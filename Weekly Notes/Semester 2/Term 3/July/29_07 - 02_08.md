- [ ] Look at Top 3 Paper on Mendeley
- [x] Look over drive method from last week
- [x] Look over equation from last week
- [ ] Look at top paper in "Cars" collection to validate the ackerman steering equation.
	- [ ] Race car vehicle dynamics
- [ ] Validate the skid steer equation
	- Top paper in "Cars" collection
- [x] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461065
#### Research Racing

#### PocketQube

#### Notes

Get better wheel speed measurements (better encoder resolution).
- Change the PWM/second
- Make a new encoder disk
Map wheel speed and IMU measurements to detect slip.
Implement LED.
