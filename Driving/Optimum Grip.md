Vertical load on the tire is directly proportional to the grip. This means optimising the load distribution helps. Timing this correctly when the car lands well help traction.

Too fast acceleration - weight doesn't transfer to the back fast enough to increase the load.
Too slow acceleration - not enough torque to load the back.

Possible goal: accelerate the car as fast as possible to dip the back. Once the car dips, control the throttle at that point to not cause wheel-spin.

Question: slip angle has an optimum traction point. But the car does not appear to be in traction all the time. Some amount of sliding seems to be optimum in certain situation. Or is my idea of traction correct.
There must be a more complete idea on how any car can navigate any track as fast as possible. Why are rally cars faster when drifting when compared to F1 cars.

- driving 4 answers theory is that the reason the slight drift appears to be faster, is that the car is slightly over the limit, but that cornering force is slightly higher than being under the limit. But cornering at the optimum slip angle would not create sliding.
The question still remains weather or not a bit of sliding is perhaps is beneficial in certain cases. This could possibly be from the fact that you point the car at a more optimum angle for the exit, which lets you go on throttle earlier, which gives you better acceleration. Ie., a sacrifice of corner speed for straight line speed.

The friction of the tire is a combination of an adhesion and sliding frictional force. The adhesion region are temporary Van Der Waal forces between the tire and road.  There is still confusion on the adhesion and sliding regions.

$\mu = \mu_{Adhesion} + \mu_{Sliding}$  
$\mu_{Adhesion} > \mu_{Sliding}$ When the car is gripping the road

- Frictional force ($F_F$) is measured using brake-torque sensors 
- Normal force ($F_N$) is measured using a strain gauge
- $\mu = \frac{F_F}{F_N}$ 

Slip = $\frac{V-R \omega}{V}$ if $V > R \omega$ 
Slip = $\frac{R \omega - V}{R \omega}$ if $R \omega > V$ 

Perhaps go just before the tires begin to scrub, which slows the car down. 

THE BIG ISSUE:
HOW MUCH SLIDING IS REQUIRED FOR THE CAR TO GO AROUND THE CIRCUIT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

Logically, a car that is slipping more than it is gripping cannot have more speed than a car that is gripping more than it is slipping. Perhaps pointing the car in the optimum direction by sliding it is more useful than the cornering speed itself.

Perhaps an experiment would be useful to determine this.
