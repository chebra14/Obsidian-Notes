### Module 1: Before the Corner

##### Ch. 2: What is the braking capability of the car

We need to know how much the car can rotate at different speeds and how quickly we can get to those speeds.

Trying to find the limit safely:
- Choose a braking reference and just brake harder.
- When the longitudinal limit is reached, then start braking later.

The higher the force between tires and track, the more grip is available to alter the state of the car.

**Mechanical Grip**
- Comes from the downforce from the weight of the car.

**Aerodynamic Grip**
- The car has more contact with the track but without the inertia downside, keeping the car nimble.



##### Ch. 3: Braking from a straight line to a full stop

A low down-force car:
- You can brake a constant pressure until the car stops without locking the tires.

A high down-force car:
- The amount of braking capability increases with speed. 
- Braking from higher speeds, your speed will drop quickly, and the braking capability from the aero-setup drops.
- The braking force needs to reduce to prevent the wheels from locking.
- It is more difficult to find the optimum braking efficiency. (Gradient of deceleration).

##### Ch. 4: Press less technique

If you make too many adjustments under braking it'll be hard to know if the braking reference is good. It's better to over slow the car, allowing you to be more efficient in finding the limit later.


##### Ch. 5: Compressions, crests, and bumps

Changes in elevation will change the amount of traction available for braking.

- Compression => Car gains grip => Threshold braking is **higher**.
- Over crest => track falls away from the car => tires have less contact => Threshold braking is **lesser**.

Corkscrew at Laguna Seca:
- Right rink, then the crest ends.
- Downhill on a flat surface, more grip than the crest.
- Results in: Higher pressure => Low pressure => high pressure.

Sometimes you might brake over a bump, and then loose grip and lock a wheel. The input from the brakes should be active to account for this.


##### Ch. 6: Initial pressure to peak pressure and braking references

The time between initial and peak pressure needs to be accounted for. This is to make sure that the braking references used are consistent from lap to lap.

High downforce, light and stiff suspension cars:
- Accept faster braking application.
-
Low downforce, heavy and soft suspension cars:
- Benefit from a slightly slower brake application.

##### Ch. 7: Light hands under braking

Optimal braking happens when 0.5 of the weight is on the right and 0.5 of the weight is on the left.
- Relaxing the steering allows the self-centering nature to account for bumps and irregularities.

##### Ch. 8: Interference between engine braking and braking

Control the engine braking by timing the downshifts to gain extra balance.

- Engine braking only affects the driven wheels.
- The higher the RPM, the higher the engine braking effect.

The downshift can be used as an extra rotation mechanism.
### Module 2: Into the Corner

##### Ch. 1: Initial conditions of a corner

"Entry is cause, exit is consequence"

- As soon as you commit to a line and a braking reference, the amount of control is limited.
- Your'e along for the ride on the exit based on how you entered.
- For a good exit, you have to thread the needle on entry and mid-corner to position the car correctly.
##### Ch. 2: The stages of the corner

Hard braking into a corner, is the precursor to early entry.
###### **Early Entry**
- Starts from the initial transition from peak braking.
- First degrees of steering angle.
- Weight transfer starts shifting back and outward.

- Slowly transfer from brake release to steering input.
	- The buildup of rotation towards the apex will be too unstable otherwise.
	- Peak lateral grip won't be reached.

- The totality of the corner, should be one big buildup of rotation that peaks at the apex.
- Key characteristic:
	- Tendency for the car to oversteer.
		- Heavy weight on the fronts.
		- Initial trail braking phase.
		- Higher RPM.
		- Heavy engine braking effects (RWD).

###### **Late Entry**

Final build up of peak rotation.
- Committed to getting as much rotation as possible.
- Testing the grip limits.

Car tends to oversteer less than previous phase.
- Low speed.
- Low RPM.
- Low braking pressure.

The safety of corner exit is directly correlated to how much rotation is achieved here.

###### **Early Exit**

- Starts at peak rotation (Maximum Rotation Point (MRP)).
- Start accelerating.
- 50% of the rotation should be done.
- NO ROTATION SHOULD BE GAINED FROM NOW.
###### **Late Exit**

Least control of the racecar. Allow the car to drift wide, and the extent will be a consequence of the previous phases.




##### Ch. 9: Maximum Rotation Point (MRP)

- A fixed speed and fixed steering angle
	- No Oversteer/Understeer => Perfect circle
- Increase speed => Increasing circle
- Decrease speed = > Decreasing circle (More capacity to rotate)

![[Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 12.17.03.png]]

V-shape approach:
- Turns in more progressively.
- Rotation is higher at slower speeds.

U-shaped approach:
- High-downforce cars.
- Extra down-force adds some cornering capability.
	- Compensates for natural V-shape tendencies that inertia causes.
- Rotation doesn't start as linearly.


##### Ch. 11: Double apex: high downforce vs low downforce

Short 180$^{\circ}$ hairpin
- Brake in a straight line, slow the car down.
- Have lots of rotation in a short amount of time.

Long 180$^{\circ}$ hairpin
- You spend a lot more time in the corner => The braking duration is higher.
- Braking for longer => Carry more speed by braking softer while making the turn.
- V-shape emerges from trail braking => You'll naturally hit 2 spots.

_"In low downforce cars, a double apex will have:"_

- Earlier turn-in,  
- A more elliptical line,  
- More progressive/exponential steering input, 
- More trail braking into the corner, 
- Bigger distance between the apexes.

_"In high downforce cars, a double apex will have:"_

- Later turn-in,  
- A more circular line,  
- More linear steering input,  
- Less trail braking into the corner, 
- Lower distance between the apexes.




##### Ch. 15: Elevation and camber changes

- Directly alters the available mechanical grip.

- Compressions: Increase the amount of grip
	- Elevation increase from a flat track.
	- Elevation increase onto the flat track.
	- Ask more from the car due to grip increase.
	- Happens over a small time, and the conditions change quickly.
	- Car feels heavier.

- Decompressions: Decrease the amount of grip
	- Track starts to fall away.
	- Car feels lighter.
	- Red Bull Ring (Turn 1). COTA (Turn 1).
	
- Camber changes.
	- On-camber => increase.
	- Off-camber => decrease.
- Crossing a camber change is important to predict over the racing line.


### Module 3: Car Handling
##### Ch. 5: Feeling understeer and oversteer

- Oversteer is always a reaction.
	- The front tires need to initiate the rotation before the rears start to give up.

- How a driver feels understeer
	- The car locks itself into a path.
	- Pushes forward like it's on rails.
	- The path of the car will be more predictable.

Suellio equates _**Slip Angle**_ and _**Scrub**_. This might be an indication of what racing drivers refer to as slip angle. Imagine the car "scrubbing" across the road at a different yaw angle.
##### Ch. 9: Three (four) tools for rotation on entry

Four mechanisms
- Steering
- Trail Braking
	- Empowers or lessens the rotational capability of the car. 
- Engine Braking
	- Acts as very light brakes on the rear tires (of RWD cars). 
	- Downshifting.
		- Engine braking at high RPM.
		- Change in RPM upsets the rear tires.
- Maintenance Throttle

Car setup and brake balance are factors too, but cannot be changed mid-corner.


##### Ch. 11: Weight transfer: A tool for rotation management

Braking and turning weight transfer

- Light braking
	- Little more rotation without too much stress.
- Ideal braking
	- Little bit of oversteer.
- Excessive braking while turning
	- Tire locking and loss of grip

Accelerating and turning weight stransfer

- No wheel-spin
	- Understeer, no stress.
- Edge of wheel-spin
	- Controllable oversteer (optimal).
- Wheel-spin
	- Loss of rear grip.




##### Ch. 13: Exponential steering vs linear steering

Low downforce cars
- Progressive steering input
- Can't rotate well at high-speed
- Steering is more exponential

High downforce cars
- Rotate more on entry
- Start turning later in the corner
- Steering angle is more linear since there can be more rotation entry


##### Ch. 14 Light hands technique

Gripping the wheel too hard will prevent the car from naturally adjusting to the track surface.

Passive counter-steering. The car has a self-centering tendency which should be allowed when correcting oversteer.
