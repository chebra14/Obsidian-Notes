##### Ch. 2: What is the braking capability of the car

We need to know how much the car can rotate at different speeds and how quickly we can get to those speeds.

Trying to find the limit safely:
- Choose a braking reference and just brake harder.
- When the longitudinal limit is reached, then start braking later.

The higher the force between tires and track, the more grip is available to alter the state of the car.

**Mechanical Grip**
- Comes from the downforce from the weight of the car.

**Aerodynamic Grip**
- The car has more contact with the track but without the inertia downside, keeping the car nimble.



##### Ch. 3: Braking from a straight line to a full stop

A low down-force car:
- You can brake a constant pressure until the car stops without locking the tires.

A high down-force car:
- The amount of braking capability increases with speed. 
- Braking from higher speeds, your speed will drop quickly, and the braking capability from the aero-setup drops.
- The braking force needs to reduce to prevent the wheels from locking.
- It is more difficult to find the optimum braking efficiency. (Gradient of deceleration).

##### Ch. 4: Press less technique

If you make too many adjustments under braking it'll be hard to know if the braking reference is good. It's better to over slow the car, allowing you to be more efficient in finding the limit later.


##### Ch. 5: Compressions, crests, and bumps

Changes in elevation will change the amount of traction available for braking.

- Compression => Car gains grip => Threshold braking is **higher**.
- Over crest => track falls away from the car => tires have less contact => Threshold braking is **lesser**.

Corkscrew at Laguna Seca:
- Right rink, then the crest ends.
- Downhill on a flat surface, more grip than the crest.
- Results in: Higher pressure => Low pressure => high pressure.

Sometimes you might brake over a bump, and then loose grip and lock a wheel. The input from the brakes should be active to account for this.


##### Ch. 6: Initial pressure to peak pressure and braking references

The time between initial and peak pressure needs to be accounted for. This is to make sure that the braking references used are consistent from lap to lap.

High downforce, light and stiff suspension cars:
- Accept faster braking application.
-
Low downforce, heavy and soft suspension cars:
- Benefit from a slightly slower brake application.

##### Ch. 7: Light hands under braking

Optimal braking happens when 0.5 of the weight is on the right and 0.5 of the weight is on the left.
- Relaxing the steering allows the self-centering nature to account for bumps and irregularities.

##### Ch. 8: Interference between engine braking and braking

Control the engine braking by timing the downshifts to gain extra balance.

- Engine braking only affects the driven wheels.
- The higher the RPM, the higher the engine braking effect.

The downshift can be used as an extra rotation mechanism.
