### Chapter 6: Tire Behaviour

#### How a car turns
##### Slip Angle

Due to the elastic nature of the tire.
- Tire grips the road but yields to an external force.
- Resists movement from the force
- Recovers when the force is removed
Allows the tire to be pointed in a different direction the car is heading

- The tire rolls into and out of the contact patch
- Steering causes the tire to turn
- The leading edge of the tire rotates to a slightly different direction

If the rear wheels were mounted like castors, they would swivel around away from the corner.

##### Lateral Force vs. Slip Angle

![[Fig6.4PH.png]]

Linear region
- Slope is the tire stiffness
- Not sliding at any point on the contact patch

Transition region
- Portions of the tire patch are sliding
- Increase in the amount that the contact patch is sliding

Frictional region
- Tire slides more and and starts producing less lateral force
- Most of the contact patch is sliding

#### Longitudinal forces

There is some longitudinal slip in the contact patch when braking and accelerating.

#### Combined forces

#### Friction circle

#### Lateral deformation of the tread

![[Fig6.12PH.png]]

From point A to point B, somewhere near the mid-line of the contact patch, the tread stays stuck the road and lateral deflection in the carcass and tread increases linearly.

At some point the force required to deflect the tread exceeds the $C_f \times N$ and the tread begins to slide on the road.
*At what point?*
#### Self-aligning torque (SAT)

![[Fig6.13PH.png]]

The 'Total Lateral Force' is at a distance 'T' from the 'Midline' it creates a moment. This moment is the SAT.

![[Fig6.15PH.png]]

As we corner harder, steering forces go up, and then fall off as the rear portion of the contact patch begins to slide.

T decreases as the slip angle increases. This causes the SAT to tend to 0.
#### Dynamic tire response to steering

There is a delay between steering and the load going to the tires.

#### Rolling resistance

Rolling resistance increases with speed and load.

#### Induced drag

![[Fig6.19PH.png]]

This force increases with lateral force and slip angle

#### Camber thrust

![[Fig6.21PH.png]]

Negative camber towards the car.

#### Stagger

Increase in tire pressure, can increase the size of the tire (0.2"-0.5"). The indy cars have a solid axle, then they can make the outside tire larger so it can go further with each revolution.
#### Internal pressure

At high slip angles, higher inflation pressure decreases contact patch area. With less rubber in contact with the road, friction force decreases and sliding increases. This reduces grip and increases frictional heating, further reducing grip.

### Chapter 7: Balance And Control

Tight = understeer
Loose = oversteer

(American Terms)

The torque or moment created by the force of the front tires times their distance ahead of the car's centre of gravity (CG) balances the rear-tire forces times their distance behind the CG. 

As a result the front and rear tire forces can be combined at the CG and called lateral force. 

But the front and rear tires might need different slip angles to achieve this balance. The relationship between the slip angles at the front and rear tires is what determines balance.

#### Understeer and oversteer

Understeer
- Front slip angle is greater than the rear slip angle as the car speeds up

Oversteer
- Rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle as the car speeds up

#### Consequences of imbalance

An imbalanced car has one set (front or rear) at maximum grip, while the other set has grip left on the table.

The higher slip angle on the fronts from understeer means more induced drag and it can slow the car in a corner. The engine has to overcome tire drag, so tire drag lowers cornering speeds.

*What if the car is too understeery?*

Driver 1 feels the rear of the car move as the rear tires tried to go to a slip angle that would produce the lateral force necessary to keep the car in the turn. They don't have the confidence that there was a limit to the movement they feel, so they steered into the turn to correct their perceived oversteer. 

Driver 1's front tires were at a higher slip angle than Driver 2 and produced more drag for the same lateral grip. Driver 1's rear tires were at a smaller slip angle and weren't generating as much lateral grip as Driver 2's. Driver 1's car also had bigger Gurney flaps and higher
angles of attack on the wings. The result was slower lap times.
