### What is trajectory optimisation

- Set of mathematical techniques used to find the ideal or desired behaviour for a dynamical system.
- For example swinging a pendulum on a kart to face up by applying a force onto the kart. What applied force would create the desired effect?

### An optimal trajectory

- minimize objective functiom
- subjecr to dyamics and constraints

*The system is second order therefore the rates are also required. Number of degrees of freedom equal number of states.

### Optimal Control

- Find the best choice of controls to achieve some desired goal
