Dale:

... A lot of people were making a big deal out of heel-and-toe. 25 years ago, before we made transmissions that would allow you to not use the clutch to shift, every driver in the cup series, '86 '87, had to. Tear the transmission, wear it out. We did it out of necessity. There was a big debate about paddles, and shifting how that would effect, and take away some tools. Paul put this video out driving around his course, (most likely this - ![[Paul Morris Manual vs Assisted Shifts]])...
...showing why heel-and-toe is important, why it makes a driver unique and how a driver uses to change the balance of the car. I never knew that.

Shane:

We need it in our things because we have a solid axle, locked differential. So you're trying to run as much rear brake as possible, to turn the car, and use the brake to turn it. So you can use the clutch to take away a bit of rear brake... in the straight line and stop the rear locking. I could use it a bit in the NASCAR but obviously that diff is more open, so it's not as critical, but I saw a lot of people were struggling on the bumps.

Dale:

So if there is a lot of content on the track, it would be helpful?

Shane:

It would definitely be helpful. You can just dip the clutch over the bumps, and it takes away all the compression.

Dale:

So in a braking zone, you get ripples and so forth. you get a lot of content. But I felt like, trying to help people understand, that heel-and-toe, it's a habit if you're racing a car that has to be used that way, and to keep the transmission from blowing up, but also it effects the balance of the car, and it kind of turns the car it into the corner.

...

Dale:

The way you get around that track (possibly Indianapolis Raceway Park), is kind of wonky. You can move that apex wherever you want at that track right, depending on the balance of your truck. And so it's not as straight forward as a lot of ovals.

Shane:

Is it because the surface is better? Or is it because of the banking? How does it work?

Dale:

Yeah I think it's because there is a little bit of more banking in the top groove, so if you need to put the right rear up there and get some turn, you know. If you need to drift up there, if your truck is turning too good, you certainly don't want to get up on that, you want to kind of hang lower and run tighter.
