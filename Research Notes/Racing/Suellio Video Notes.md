Understeer
- Increase in steering more doesn't change turning
Oversteer
- Increase in steering changes turning dramatically
Under the limit
- Increase in steering changes turning proportionally

Fishing for grip (1% changes):
- happens under the limit, and determining how the car will react.
- exit is dangerous because you lose the car on power.
	- You assume you're too fast, but you induce a false slip.
	- What is the load change in having a sharp input vs a smooth one?

How can you find the limit of you're not on the limit?
- Reach understeer at the min. speed
	- Reduce trail braking
	- Apply small throttle

Understeer = Carry more speed (Maybe more acceleration)
Oversteer = Turn more
