#### General

- Clean: maximum speed through long fast corner.
- Short shifting helps balance the car on exit.
- High curbs will "throw you off". 
- When starting a lap, take final corner wider than normal for more straight line speed. 
- Braking on the limit is the biggest time to gain
- You save fuel by lift and coast and downshift later, upshift earlier, higher engine braking
	- Lift off about 50m before the braking
	- The faster you go the more you can do it. 

- In general, it would make sense to adjust the brake balance:
	- Downhill - Front
	- Uphill - Rears

#### MONZA

![[Italy_Circuit.avif]]

- Turn 1: Very bumpy, which causes a lot of "rear under-rotation and locking".
	- Solution: Condense the downshifting until the end of the corner, which causes the majority of the braking to be smoother, and all the disturbances are condensed at the end.

- Turn 6: Braking into the corner. Unloading the front tires.
	- Brake balance rear-wards. Engine braking up. Helps with the understeer mid-corner and get the car turned.

- Turn 8: Straight braking again.
	- Brake balance forward, engine braking lower.
	- The limit to how much curb you can take is the maximum amount of "bottoming-out".

5-6 seconds behind the driver in front. Best range for have the air parted for the car, and for the cornering not to be effected. 

#### SPA

**In the wet**

- Be 1 gear higher than in the dry

- Safety lift of 20%

- In general, brake balance should be more rearwards
	- less grip
	- less braking
	- less pitch and momentum
	- less potential on the fronts

- Wet and dry at the same time.
	- Remember from last lap where it's wet/dry.
	- Top of the lap is where it's most wet.
	- Puddles and rivers.
	- Cars going on sections more and faster, will dry first.

- The longer of sequence of corners, the more heating you'll get.
	- The snappier it gets the hotter the rears get.
	- The tires only cool down on the straights.
#### SILVERSTONE

![[Great_Britain_Circuit.avif]]


- Turn 6: The entry is very long so there is a lot of understeer. Front is overheating.
	-  Rearwards on the brake balance. Release workload from the front tires.
	- Open the differential a little bit more.
		- Usual downside is that there is a tendency snap on entry.
		- Not a problem for this corner.

_*When the driver refers to flicking the car in, it usually implies a less progressive turn, but quite quick snap of steering._

- Sector 3: Increase engine braking:
	- There is a lot of understeer in the next section,
	- In the off-throttle, and off-brakes, the engine braking is the deciding factor.
	- Helps to get the car pointed and on the throttle early. 

- High speed track
	- Stiffer car
	- Down on aero

- Wind behind
	- Brake earlier.
	- Less wind in the front => less downforce.
- Wind ahead
	- Brake later.
	- More wind => more downforce.
	- Back on power => then the wind is at the back.

#### SPANISH

![[Spain_Circuit.avif]]

WIND

- Turn 5: The track drops away
	- There are lots of black lines that show the locking up. 
	- Use more engine braking. 
		- There is no difference initially. 
		- As there is a release of brakes, the engine braking becomes more dominant.
		- At the MRP, the engine brake is like a "little handbrake" which is helping the rear to step out, and have some more rotation. 
	- There is a lot of grip on the exit, because the wing is 50% more and going towards you.
		- You can get on power earlier and more aggressive. 

- Turn 6: Short corner, oversteer tendency on entry
	- Reduce the engine braking again.

- Turn 10: Big braking
	- Brake balance forwards. 
		- Braking harder and longer and straighter.
		- Fronts have a need more potential. 
		- Otherwise the rears lock and overheat.
			- Leads to oversteer.
	- Wind at the back on entry.
		- Be careful and not have wheel-spin.
		- Gives more grip for the next 5 corners.
		- Remove any lateral loads. 
			- Straight steering.


#### BRAZIL

![[Brazil_Circuit.avif]]

- Turn 4: Off comber, trying to push you off
	- Steer late.
	- If you go to out on the exit, it pulls you further out because of the camber.

- Turn 7: Don't brake too late or too hard.
	- Next apex is important.
	- Do everything smooth, the car needs to stay flat. 
		- Keep a little bit f throttle while braking. 

Dealing with undulations 
- Softer springs
	- The car can take the bumps smoother
	- Downside, more roll, less aerodynamic working well










#### HUNGARORING

![[Hungary_Circuit.avif]]


- Turn 1: the turn-in is very late
	- Brake balance forward

- Turn 2: Deep braking, turning while downshifting
	- The inside front lifts a lot
		- Rearward brake balance

- Turn 8: Light braking
	- The nose will dive, and the rear becomes too unsettled
	- Even might keep a little bit of throttle on

- Turn 13: Deep braking
	- Brake balance rearwards
	- Front inside is gonna be up, hence inside wheel locking


#### MONACO

![[Monaco_Circuit.avif]]

 - Turn 1: Steering and Braking
	 - The inside front loads a lot.


#### NÃœRBURGRING

![[Germany_Circuit.avif]]

- Turn 1: Headwind
	- Brake aggressively
- Downhill, track drops away
	- Middle position brake balance
- Apex drops away
	- 1-2m has more grip, so it's not critical to hit the apex

- Turn 5: Brake while steering a lot
	- Front locking
	- Rear brake balance up

- Turn 13: Braking uphill
	- Brake balance forward
	- Tailwind could upset the rear

#### PORTIMAO

![[Portimao.avif]]

- On the straight, look in 0.5m Intervals
	- Least bumps

- Turn 5: Downhill lead-up to corner with headwind
	- Braking is later, when car is settled
	-  Less deceleration (downhill) +
	- Wind from the front
	- = Aggressive braking since they cancel out

- Turn 7: Brake and turning
	- Brake balance rearwards to prevent front locking
	- Brake softly, less potential for braking since turning

- Turn 11: Track drops away on exit
	- Rear is going to unload
	- Less downforce, less grip
	- Careful on throttle

- Turn 14: You turn into the wind
	- You can be more progressively aggressive on throttle


#### IMOLA

![[Imola.avif]]

- Turn 5/6
	- The first part is not so important
		- So you can lift slightly but position yourself well for Turn 6
	- Tap the brakes slightly
	- Wide entry, smooth on the brakes
	- A lot of change of direction, so being hard on the brakes will unsettle the car too much

- Turn 9
	- Brake a little bit
	- Settled
	- Late entry - Leave downshifting in the end in the middle to help rotate the car
	- Makes the car settled

- Turn 17: Off camber turn in
