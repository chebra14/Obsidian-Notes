Right foot braking can have advantage in endurance races

- The throttle and brake doesn't overlap
- This could waste fuel, as the engine overcomes the engine forces

Left foot brake has an advantage

- Te balance can be better and the brake application can be smoother.
- Can be more complex to downshift
