COMPRESSION LOCKING

When would the driver use the gearbox to influence the car's handling?

- Most of the time it's going to be on corner entry and mid-corner.
- Adelaide at the hair-pin
	- Driver goes for a pass.
	- They'll go on the inside of someone.
	- A bit compromised on the corner entry.
	- They're not quite going to make the turn.
	- They're hard on the brakes.
	- They're going to need some rotation to help the car turn...
	- THEY'LL FEED THE GEAR EARLY
	- IT'LL LOCK THE REAR END UP
	- HELP ROTATE THE CAR
	- LIKE A HANDBRAKE
		- USING THE COMPRESSION AND RELEASE OF THE CLUTCH FOR ROTATION
- Could even be used mid corner
	- Brake late into the corner
	- Got a little bit of understeer
	- Start going down the gears
	- They'll leave the gear change to when they need it and when they want the rotation
	- Use the release of the clutch to help get a little bit of rotation off the rear axle
