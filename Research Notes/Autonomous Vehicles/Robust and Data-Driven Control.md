What are the challenges?

- The force generating mechanism of the tire is highly non-linear.
	- Tire wear.
	- Weather conditions.
	- The current models aren't good:
		- Overfit to specific situations.
		- Outside factors aren't taken into account.
- The suspension and tire dynamics are too complex.

This paper tackles these challenges using robust and data-driven methods.
