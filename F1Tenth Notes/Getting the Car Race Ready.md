#### VESC HFI Tuning

Try adjusting the inductance value of the motor that might help with the 45 deg silenced mode which can have more available torque from the motor.

#### Start Stop Test

The board that the lidar bounces off is tilted.
- Pitch forward is amplified.
- Pitch back is de-amplified
If the car veers from the straight the distance from the lidar increases and becomes inaccurate.

Current issue *Can't go backwards
