**Trying to get Simulator working on VS Code on Mac:**
use zsh not python terminal

Simulator performance:
- Power to all wheels
	- FW, AW (Done), RW

- Noise
	- Changes in load ($d_fz \neq 0$)
		- Bumps
		- Camber
		- Elevation
	- Gear Changes

- How can the car use all disturbances to its advantage

*Consider safety to protect the car form crashes
