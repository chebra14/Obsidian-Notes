Tenth scale RC cars tend to take a tighter line. Point and shoot or rolling the speed is a style. But perhaps there are optimum situations for either.

All a car is, is a set of tires on the ground, with a platform that can change it's load. The tires can also control the load by moving (steering and rotating).

Categorising Possibilities

Possibility 1:
The car is on rails, going at the peak grip on all 4 tires at the same time.

Possibility 2:
A small amount of rotation (over-steer) points the car better for the exit.

Issues:
- What about dirt? Why do rally cars go faster when drifting?
- Some cars drift a lot more.
- Older F1 cars slide a lot more than modern ones.

It all comes down to:
- The fastest and most efficient way to point the car, and get it to rotate.
- Get a good exit for a better acceleration.
- Determining how to sacrifice one corner for a more important one or a good straightaway speed.
