#### Research and Development Workflow

![[Research Workflow.PNG]]

Devices Used:
- MacBook + Brandon_128
- iPad + Apple Pencil

Everything used on the devices:
- OneDrive
- Firefox
	- Git (https://github.com/)
	- Mendeley (https://www.mendeley.com/reference-manager/library/all-references/)
	- Courses
- Obsidian
- Slack
- Outlook
- Teams
- Apple Notes + iCloud

Everything is accessed on the Dock of the MacBook and the iPad.
##### Capture Sources
This is where multiple resources are used to collect information and ideas

- Websites
	- ![[Resources#Resource Websites]]
	- Firefox bookmarks
		- Resources folder for information
			- Git
			- Mendeley
		- Google search and ChatGPT to search information
		- Courses
			- ![[Resources#Courses]]

- Books, papers, etc
	- Upload to Mendeley (see Firefox bookmarks)

- Social Media
	- Youtube playlists (https://www.youtube.com/feed/playlists)
	- Instagram "F1Tenth" playlist
	- Slack Posts

- From people
	- Myself (Ideas I have)
	- Supervisors (Willem and Ben)
	- Others

##### Capture Method and Sync
This is where the information from all the sources is put into a place for future reference (to avoid returning to original source every time).

Obsidian
- All information should be put into Obsidian with a few exceptions
- Done on the MacBook
Apple Notes
- This is for notes that require drawing and rough ideas
- All the info will eventually find it's way to Obsidian
- Done on the iPad, and synced on iCloud to MacBook

Syncing:
- Work done on the linux machine is pushed to Git
- Share.txt in Masters OneDrive is used to send quick things for Copy+Paste
- Brandon_128 used as a buffer for files when simple

##### Store
This is where all the information captured is physically stored

OneDrive
- Where all files are stored

iCloud
- Rough notes from Apple Notes are stored
- Notes move eventually to OneDrive through Obsidian when the notes are formalised

Git
- Code development store
- Noted backup

Brandon_128
- Weekly storage for files, and buffer
- Things eventually move to OneDrive

##### Organise and Share
At this point, ideally:
- All notes on Obsidian
	- All external resources referenced and linked
- All files on OneDrive

Now the information needs to be used for some kind of output. Currently the only output explored is weekly meetings:
- Create KeyNote presentation based on information
- Sync to iCloud

##### Output
This is where the information collected is used and communicated with others. Involves:
- Presentations
- Papers/Thesis

Weekly presentations are communicated with the iPad with KeyNote. Papers/Thesis will likely be written in overleaf (See Firefox bookmarks)

Feedback is also captured onto the iPad ([[#Capture Sources]]).

#### Experimentation and Development Workflow

Experimentation is done with the F1Tenth Car and with the Voyager
- Notes go through Research Workflow
	- F1Tenth Notes
	- Links with the results and files
- Results and Files go to Brandon_128 then OneDrive

Development is done on the Desktop computers (Windows and Linux)
- Notes go through Research Workflow
	- Simulation Notes
	- Links with the results and files
- Results and Files go to Git, sometimes to Brandon_128 then OneDrive

- Linux for development and simulation
- Windows for Assetto Corsa simulation (Gaming)
#### Communication Workflow

- Slack (Main contact in ESL)
- Outlook (Emails and scheduling)
- Teams (Meetings)
